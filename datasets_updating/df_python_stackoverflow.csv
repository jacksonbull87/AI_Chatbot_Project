12,"It is conventional to number the three persons of Latin and Greek and many other languages so that the first person is the speaker, the second one is the listener, and the third one is anyone else.
Did the ancient grammarians already have this numbering?
If yes, was it an explicit numbering (first, second, third) or a more implicit ordering (always giving things in the order facio–facis–facit)?",This numbering goes back to Greek grammarians. Here is the Τέχνη Γραμματική (Art of Grammar) ascribed to Dionysius Thrax:

You have 2 pairs of 1/2-size breakers - a.k.a., ""double stuff"" or ""tandem"". If you measure voltage between black and red (i.e., between a pair of hots) you will find 0V instead of 240V. If this was done by an actual licensed electrician, he should have his license revoked. If it was done by a handyman-acting-as-electrician, this is why most places don't allow that."

16,"I have searched for a while and I am still not sure what is the correct way to handle this issue. The problem I am facing is that I have a huge block of text, which almost ends on the end of a page, but then only like a few words go on the next page, which results in a huge gap until the next chapter starts.","Before going into any details, it's worth taking a close look at a screenshot of the first page of your test document."
17,"I have noticed in some Victorian and Edwardian texts that Scottish and Irish names beginning with ""Mac"" or ""Mc"" are usually written as ""M"" plus an apostrophe.

I had a crippling massive cyst on my fretting hand wrist 30 years ago that I had drained by a doctor.  He used a syringe and just pulled the fluid out.  It turned out that the ""massive"" cyst was really about a dozen small pea sized cysts.  It was a fairly simple procedure, not very risky, and the issue NEVER came back.  My cyst was on a nerve and it made playing impossible.  At the time I was a professional (or semi-professional) musician working in bands and doing studio work while going to school.  So this could have been the death of my work.  I tried to put up with it as long as I could and changed playing style to accommodate it.  But in the end getting rid of it was the best move.  As for changing from left to right handed playing, there is no reason to expect that the cyst won't bother you.  You'll be holding onto a pic, or using your fingers to play and that will aggravate it."

25,There is a fascinating factoid in this answer to MMRTG- thermal and electrical output:,There is Carnot's theorem for the theoretical maximum efficiency of heat engines. It is valid not only for mechanical engines like steam engines or Stirling engines but also for solid state devices like the thermocouples used in RTGs.
26,"In the base game the instructions specifically say you lose points for uncompleted destination tickets. But the Japan instructions say ""The game then ends and players calculate their final scores adding points for their Destination Cards and the Bullet Train Bonus described as follows."" See the last sentence of the first column on page 3 here. It does not say you lose points. It seems arbitrary to change the rule, but that's what it says. Maybe it's a typo/oversight? Which understanding is correct?","Yes, you do."
27,"I'm toying with the idea for a world where instead of minting coins out of valuable metals all countries us mana, the 'fuel' of magic, as a currency itself.  Since mana always has value, in it's ability to be used to cast valuable spells, and is highly portable and exchangeable it turns out to be a more convenient means of exchanging wealth.","Unless you’re going to give people a built-in mana meter, like the life clocks in In Time, you’ll need an external device for exact transfers."
28,I've created a pie graph in Illustrator using the pie graph tool.,"Copy pasting not good, use linking instead."
29,"The probability for a gas molecule to have any velocity $v$ is $0$ since there are infinite possibilities for the velocity for the gas molecule to have.
If that's so then how come the gas molecule has any velocity at all ,since according to probability there is $0$ probability for every velocity.",In this case I think the answer is given by the velocity density. In fact you cannot have a precise value of a velocity because $|\boldsymbol{v}|\doteq v\in\mathbb{R}$ and so is a dense space; clearly you have to set probability $0$ for a point in that space. But the probability to have a velocity in an interval is non-zero once you consider $v\text{d}v$.

The postgres user with username django does not have permission to create a database, hence the error message."
32,How do you cause uncaught exceptions to output via the logging module rather than to stderr?,"As Ned pointed out, sys.excepthook is invoked every time an exception is raised and uncaught.  The practical implication of this is that in your code you can override the default behavior of sys.excepthook to do whatever you want (including using logging.exception)."

36,"I need a queue which multiple threads can put stuff into, and multiple threads may read from.","Queue.Queue and collections.deque serve different purposes. Queue.Queue is intended for allowing different threads to communicate using queued messages/data, whereas collections.deque is simply intended as a datastructure. That's why Queue.Queue has methods like put_nowait(), get_nowait(), and join(), whereas collections.deque doesn't. Queue.Queue isn't intended to be used as a collection, which is why it lacks the likes of the in operator."
37,"This is the first time I've really sat down and tried python 3, and seem to be failing miserably. I have the following two files:",TL;DR: you can't do relative imports from the file you execute since __main__ module is not a part of a package.
38,"I'm trying to understand Python's approach to variable scope. In this example, why is f() able to alter the value of x, as perceived within main(), but not the value of n?","Some answers contain the word ""copy"" in a context of a function call. I find it confusing."
39,"I have been reading the Core Python programming book, and the author shows an example like: ","Tuples are compared position by position:
the first item of the first tuple is compared to the first item of the second tuple; if they are not equal (i.e. the first is greater or smaller than the second) then that's the result of the comparison, else the second item is considered, then the third and so on."

                ","""Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design"". If you are building something that is similar to a e-commerce site, then you should probably go with Django. It will get your work done quick. You dont have to worry about too many technology choices. It provides everything thing you need from template engine to ORM. It will be slightly opinionated about the way you structure your app, which is good If you ask me. And it has the strongest community of all the other libraries, which means easy help is available."

55,I'm not asking about Python's scoping rules; I understand generally how scoping works in Python for loops. My question is why the design decisions were made in this way. For example (no pun intended):,"The likeliest answer is that it just keeps the grammar simple, hasn't been a stumbling block for adoption, and many have been happy with not having to disambiguate the scope to which a name belongs when assigning to it within a loop construct.  Variables are not declared within a scope, it is implied by the location of assignment statements.  The global keyword exists just for this reason (to signify that assignment is done at a global scope)."

60,How would you go about formatting a long line such as this? I'd like to get it to no more than 80 characters wide:,That's a start.  It's not a bad practice to define your longer strings outside of the code that uses them.  It's a way to separate data and behavior.  Your first option is to join string literals together implicitly by making them adjacent to one another:

324,"In case a plane stalls, what should stall first, the tip or the root of the Wing?
Why?","It is preferable for the wing root to stall first. If the wingtip stalls before the root,
the disrupted airflow near the wingtip can reduce aileron effectiveness to such a
extent that it may be impossible to control the airplane about its longitudinal axis.
When an aircraft stalls at the root first, it means there’s enough airflow over the
tips of your wings to prevent any rapid rolling motion during a stall, which makes
the airplane more stable. It also makes your plane more resistant to entering a
spin."

Personally I can run for a few kilometers like say three maximum and for considerable slower speed than I could long before I took cycling seriously.,"Can one be good at both? There is a reasonable correlation between run and bike speed for athletes who do both, so if you are good at one there's a reasonable chance you could be good at the other. Here is a plot that shows performance for a run-bike-run duathlon. Each dot in each panel shows the speed of an individual athlete in two of the three segments of this race. As you can see, the correlations between bike speed and run speed for the opening 3K run and the ending 15K run are 0.78 and 0.76. Note that the correlation between the two running legs is only 0.88, so a bike-run correlation of 0.77 isn't bad."

They do show you the chord notated on the stave but say you should just read C above to know what chord to play.

426,"In the state of quantum superposition, as most famously illustrated by Schrodinger's Cat, we have a well-defined set of probabilistic outcomes that is not determined until observed. The cat is then said to ""really"" be in both states at once, while unobserved.","The ""classical"" form of quantum mechanics (no hidden variables or ""pilot waves"") maintains that a state exists as a superposition of all possibilities until the act of measuring that state causes the associated wavefunction to collapse.

And only when that measurement is repeated many, many times does the 40/60 split become apparent."

509,I am doing a piano course and my feeling is that they try spoon feed you every step of the way by making things very VERY simple. One example is when learning chords you are taught to recognize the letter of the chord (so for example C or Cm) and not to look at the notes on the stave. They do show you the chord notated on the stave but say you should just read C above to know what chord to play. Shouldnt the course be teaching you how to recognize the chord by looking at the intervals on the stave instead of just the chord letters/symbols on top? Is this just the lazy way to learn to play chords on the piano?,Do pianists look at the chord letter or notes on the stave to tell what chord to play?

Most vessels operating aircraft will have a radar to provide a SCA (ship controlled approach) or if the helicopter has a radar it will be able to fly its own HCA (helicopter controlled approach). Assuming the helicopter can’t get visual using these facilities (with
approach and deck lighting turned up full etc) an ELVA would be used. This involves the helicopter approaching the vessel from 180-deg at approx 2nm astern at deck height plus 10-20ft. For a carrier this would be about 60-70ft. The helicopter would normally be using a radalt height hold at this point and would close the ship at a slow speed. The ship would be dropping marker flares into the water from the stern, as the aircraft gets closer the closing speed would be reduced to 10-15kts above the ship speed until visual. Unlike a radar controlled approach, there is no planned go-around for this procedure however, if a land based diversion was available, this would be used first."

It allows to get the BPM of your audio sequence, but can do much more like identifying different parts of the music, locate transitions between similar samples. I do not know what you mean exactly by ""visualizing audio"", but I think this algorithm should provide you with enough information to start synchronizing image to the audio (if that's what you want to do)."

There are skyrmions and anti-skyrmions and if you quantize them via  a path integral in which you give a minus sign weight for a path in which a skyrmion is rotated by 360 degrees, you can give a homotopy argument involving the antiskyrmion so show that you must also give a minus sign when a skymion is exchanged with a skyrmion. Exactly what logical input is needed to precisely define ""fat"" is perhaps unlear. To me it means that there is some geometrical notion of  rotating the thing of interest, and not just an internal (mathamtical) spin degree of freedom.   The source of these ideas is surely Finkelstein and Rubenstein Connection between Spin, Statistics, and Kinks Journal of Mathematical Physics 9, 1762 (1968)."

Personally I can run for a few kilometers like say three maximum and for considerable slower speed than I could long before I took cycling seriously.,"Can one be good at both? There is a reasonable correlation between run and bike speed for athletes who do both, so if you are good at one there's a reasonable chance you could be good at the other. Here is a plot that shows performance for a run-bike-run duathlon. Each dot in each panel shows the speed of an individual athlete in two of the three segments of this race. As you can see, the correlations between bike speed and run speed for the opening 3K run and the ending 15K run are 0.78 and 0.76. Note that the correlation between the two running legs is only 0.88, so a bike-run correlation of 0.77 isn't bad."

1836,I wish to place a python program on GitHub and have other people download and run it on their computers with assorted operating systems. I am relatively new to python but have used it enough to have noticed that getting the assorted versions of all the included modules to work together can be problematic. I just discovered the use of requirements.txt (generated with pipreqs and deployed with the command pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt) but was very surprised to notice that requirements.txt does not actually state what version of python is being used so obviously it is not the complete solution on its own. So my question is: what set of specifications/files/something-else is needed to ensure that someone downloading my project will actually be able to run it with the fewest possible problems.,Have you considered setting up a setup.py file?

Why?","It is preferable for the wing root to stall first. If the wingtip stalls before the root,
the disrupted airflow near the wingtip can reduce aileron effectiveness to such a
extent that it may be impossible to control the airplane about its longitudinal axis.
When an aircraft stalls at the root first, it means there’s enough airflow over the
tips of your wings to prevent any rapid rolling motion during a stall, which makes
the airplane more stable. It also makes your plane more resistant to entering a
spin."

There is a reasonable correlation between run and bike speed for athletes who do both, so if you are good at one there's a reasonable chance you could be good at the other. Here is a plot that shows performance for a run-bike-run duathlon. Each dot in each panel shows the speed of an individual athlete in two of the three segments of this race. As you can see, the correlations between bike speed and run speed for the opening 3K run and the ending 15K run are 0.78 and 0.76. Note that the correlation between the two running legs is only 0.88, so a bike-run correlation of 0.77 isn't bad."

But the probability to have a velocity in an interval is non-zero once you consider $v\text{d}v$.,"Yes, you do."

2595,"My experience is circa 1990s, but I can offer some perspective on US fixed wing operations.","Although I can’t detail fixed wing operations at sea, many countries operating helicopters use an ELVA procedure, an Emergency Low Visibility Approach. Most vessels operating aircraft will have a radar to provide a SCA (ship controlled approach) or if the helicopter has a radar it will be able to fly its own HCA (helicopter controlled approach). Assuming the helicopter can’t get visual using these facilities (with
approach and deck lighting turned up full etc) an ELVA would be used. This involves the helicopter approaching the vessel from 180-deg at approx 2nm astern at deck height plus 10-20ft. For a carrier this would be about 60-70ft. The helicopter would normally be using a radalt height hold at this point and would close the ship at a slow speed.

2596,"Although I can’t detail fixed wing operations at sea, many countries operating helicopters use an ELVA procedure, an Emergency Low Visibility Approach. Most vessels operating aircraft will have a radar to provide a SCA (ship controlled approach) or if the helicopter has a radar it will be able to fly its own HCA (helicopter controlled approach). Assuming the helicopter can’t get visual using these facilities (with
approach and deck lighting turned up full etc) an ELVA would be used. This involves the helicopter approaching the vessel from 180-deg at approx 2nm astern at deck height plus 10-20ft. For a carrier this would be about 60-70ft. The helicopter would normally be using a radalt height hold at this point and would close the ship at a slow speed. The ship would be dropping marker flares into the water from the stern, as the aircraft gets closer the closing speed would be reduced to 10-15kts above the ship speed until visual.

the disrupted airflow near the wingtip can reduce aileron effectiveness to such a
extent that it may be impossible to control the airplane about its longitudinal axis.
When an aircraft stalls at the root first, it means there’s enough airflow over the
tips of your wings to prevent any rapid rolling motion during a stall, which makes
the airplane more stable. It also makes your plane more resistant to entering a
spin."

They do show you the chord notated on the stave but say you should just read C above to know what chord to play. Shouldnt the course be teaching you how to recognize the chord by looking at the intervals on the stave instead of just the chord letters/symbols on top?

My cyst was on a nerve and it made playing impossible.  At the time I was a professional (or semi-professional) musician working in bands and doing studio work while going to school.  So this could have been the death of my work.  I tried to put up with it as long as I could and changed playing style to accommodate it.  But in the end getting rid of it was the best move.

3653,We have some large binary number N (large means millions of digits). We also have binary mask M where 1 means that we must remove digit in this position in number N and move all higher bits one position right.,"While this may not be possible without a loop in python, it can be made extremely fast with numba and just in time compilation. I went on the assumption that your inputs could be easily represented as boolean arrays, which would be very simple to construct from a binary file using struct. The method I have implemented involves iterating a few different objects, however these iterations were chosen carefully to make sure they were compiler optimized, and never doing the same work twice. The first iteration is using np.where to locate the indices of all the bits to delete. This specific function (among many others) is optimized by the numba compiler. I then use this list of bit indices to build the slice indices for slices of bits to keep. The final loop copies these slices to an empty output array."

Here is a plot that shows performance for a run-bike-run duathlon. Each dot in each panel shows the speed of an individual athlete in two of the three segments of this race. As you can see, the correlations between bike speed and run speed for the opening 3K run and the ending 15K run are 0.78 and 0.76. Note that the correlation between the two running legs is only 0.88, so a bike-run correlation of 0.77 isn't bad."

Why?","It is preferable for the wing root to stall first. If the wingtip stalls before the root,
the disrupted airflow near the wingtip can reduce aileron effectiveness to such a
extent that it may be impossible to control the airplane about its longitudinal axis.
When an aircraft stalls at the root first, it means there’s enough airflow over the
tips of your wings to prevent any rapid rolling motion during a stall, which makes
the airplane more stable. It also makes your plane more resistant to entering a
spin."

Shouldnt the course be teaching you how to recognize the chord by looking at the intervals on the stave instead of just the chord letters/symbols on top? Is this just the lazy way to learn to play chords on the piano?,Do pianists look at the chord letter or notes on the stave to tell what chord to play?

There he had the aid of the Dwarves of Erebor; and there was a great battle at the Mountain's feet. It lasted three days, but in the end both King Brand and King Dáin Ironfoot were slain, and the Easterlings had the victory. But they could not take the Gate, and many, both Dwarves and Men, took refuge in Erebor, and there withstood a siege.

3844,In a chat group of a local cycling community a hot debate arose about running. This is something that most cyclists shun greatly and few can manage it for a few kilometers. Personally I can run for a few kilometers like say three maximum and for considerable slower speed than I could long before I took cycling seriously.,"Can one be good at both? There is a reasonable correlation between run and bike speed for athletes who do both, so if you are good at one there's a reasonable chance you could be good at the other.

As you can see, the correlations between bike speed and run speed for the opening 3K run and the ending 15K run are 0.78 and 0.76. Note that the correlation between the two running legs is only 0.88, so a bike-run correlation of 0.77 isn't bad."

4045,In a chat group of a local cycling community a hot debate arose about running. This is something that most cyclists shun greatly and few can manage it for a few kilometers. Personally I can run for a few kilometers like say three maximum and for considerable slower speed than I could long before I took cycling seriously.,"Can one be good at both? There is a reasonable correlation between run and bike speed for athletes who do both, so if you are good at one there's a reasonable chance you could be good at the other. Here is a plot that shows performance for a run-bike-run duathlon. Each dot in each panel shows the speed of an individual athlete in two of the three segments of this race. As you can see, the correlations between bike speed and run speed for the opening 3K run and the ending 15K run are 0.78 and 0.76. Note that the correlation between the two running legs is only 0.88, so a bike-run correlation of 0.77 isn't bad."

As far as I know, it is recommended that you feed starter for about 7-0 days before you use it to make bread. My question is, why? If my starter is already growing, it means that the yeast in there is alive and well. How would the bread be different if I made it from the starter I have today, vs the one I will have in a week?","The advice to let the culture mature before you use it is targeted to getting reliable results. A mature sourdough culture has a relatively small number of strains of microorganism, which have outcompeted the others and formed a relatively stable ecology (assuming a regular feeding schedule). At that point the culture is reliable because newly introduced strains can't compete with the established ones. A new sourdough culture may work fine (particularly if you're seeing vigorous activity), or it may be not great, or it may be the best sourdough you've ever tasted. But the bread you make with it today may be significantly different from next week's."

4253,I am doing a piano course and my feeling is that they try spoon feed you every step of the way by making things very VERY simple. One example is when learning chords you are taught to recognize the letter of the chord (so for example C or Cm) and not to look at the notes on the stave. They do show you the chord notated on the stave but say you should just read C above to know what chord to play. Shouldnt the course be teaching you how to recognize the chord by looking at the intervals on the stave instead of just the chord letters/symbols on top? Is this just the lazy way to learn to play chords on the piano?,Do pianists look at the chord letter or notes on the stave to tell what chord to play?

There is a reasonable correlation between run and bike speed for athletes who do both, so if you are good at one there's a reasonable chance you could be good at the other. Here is a plot that shows performance for a run-bike-run duathlon. Each dot in each panel shows the speed of an individual athlete in two of the three segments of this race. As you can see, the correlations between bike speed and run speed for the opening 3K run and the ending 15K run are 0.78 and 0.76.

6019,"In case a plane stalls, what should stall first, the tip or the root of the Wing?
Why?","It is preferable for the wing root to stall first. If the wingtip stalls before the root,
the disrupted airflow near the wingtip can reduce aileron effectiveness to such a
extent that it may be impossible to control the airplane about its longitudinal axis.
When an aircraft stalls at the root first, it means there’s enough airflow over the
tips of your wings to prevent any rapid rolling motion during a stall, which makes
the airplane more stable. It also makes your plane more resistant to entering a
spin."

It lasted three days, but in the end both King Brand and King Dáin Ironfoot were slain, and the Easterlings had the victory.

As you can see, the correlations between bike speed and run speed for the opening 3K run and the ending 15K run are 0.78 and 0.76.

Most vessels operating aircraft will have a radar to provide a SCA (ship controlled approach) or if the helicopter has a radar it will be able to fly its own HCA (helicopter controlled approach). Assuming the helicopter can’t get visual using these facilities (with
approach and deck lighting turned up full etc) an ELVA would be used. This involves the helicopter approaching the vessel from 180-deg at approx 2nm astern at deck height plus 10-20ft. For a carrier this would be about 60-70ft. The helicopter would normally be using a radalt height hold at this point and would close the ship at a slow speed. The ship would be dropping marker flares into the water from the stern, as the aircraft gets closer the closing speed would be reduced to 10-15kts above the ship speed until visual. Unlike a radar controlled approach, there is no planned go-around for this procedure however, if a land based diversion was available, this would be used first."

7818,I am doing a piano course and my feeling is that they try spoon feed you every step of the way by making things very VERY simple. One example is when learning chords you are taught to recognize the letter of the chord (so for example C or Cm) and not to look at the notes on the stave. They do show you the chord notated on the stave but say you should just read C above to know what chord to play. Shouldnt the course be teaching you how to recognize the chord by looking at the intervals on the stave instead of just the chord letters/symbols on top?

Is that possible?,"The _numpy module is not included by default with the sandboxed version, because nobody carefully checked that it is safe to include it.  Roughly speaking it should be, but there are many details that can go wrong: for example, maybe some obscure sequence of calls can lead to an out-of-bound memory access (contrast this with the sandboxing approach taken on the rest of PyPy, which works out of the box for all internal object manipulations, because they are done on GC-managed arrays rather than on raw malloc()ed memory).  There is also the risk that some obscure function implemented in a C library used by _numpy would offer an escape point to an attacker.  All in all I'd say that the approach does not work for _numpy (unless someone paranoid enough would really check its safety after every _numpy change, which is very unlikely to occur).  Consider using an OS-level sandboxing instead, with either a regular PyPy or CPython."

They do show you the chord notated on the stave but say you should just read C above to know what chord to play.

Why?","It is preferable for the wing root to stall first. If the wingtip stalls before the root,
the disrupted airflow near the wingtip can reduce aileron effectiveness to such a
extent that it may be impossible to control the airplane about its longitudinal axis.
When an aircraft stalls at the root first, it means there’s enough airflow over the
tips of your wings to prevent any rapid rolling motion during a stall, which makes
the airplane more stable. It also makes your plane more resistant to entering a
spin."

Perhaps instead of setting a mileage goal set a time/distance goal on some rides. That way you won't be  mentally locked in the distance mindset.","Expects an array of entries in the following format: [[a,b,c,d], correct, wrong_place], where a to d are integers in [0..7]."
