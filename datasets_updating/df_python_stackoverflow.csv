19,Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:,"Actually, this is not a design flaw, and it is not because of internals, or performance.
It comes simply from the fact that functions in Python are first-class objects, and not only a piece of code."
20,"While using new_list = my_list, any modifications to new_list changes my_list everytime. Why is this, and how can I clone or copy the list to prevent it?","With new_list = my_list, you don't actually have two lists. The assignment just copies the reference to the list, not the actual list, so both new_list and my_list refer to the same list after the assignment."
21,How do I concatenate two lists in Python?,You can use the + operator to combine them:
22,"I'm trying to understand the use of super(). From the looks of it, both child classes can be created, just fine.

Python 3.4 (released March 2014) and Python 2.7.9 (released December 2014) ship with Pip. This is the best feature of any Python release. It makes the community's wealth of libraries accessible to everyone. Newbies are no longer excluded from using community libraries by the prohibitive difficulty of setup. In shipping with a package manager, Python joins Ruby, Node.js, Haskell, Perl, Go—almost every other contemporary language with a majority open-source community. Thank you, Python."

31,"It is my understanding that the range() function, which is actually an object type in Python 3, generates its contents on the fly, similar to a generator. ","The Python 3 range() object doesn't produce numbers immediately; it is a smart sequence object that produces numbers on demand. All it contains is your start, stop and step values, then as you iterate over the object the next integer is calculated each iteration."

35,Behind this blank face plate is a coaxial cable. I already have a coaxial cable in the middle of this room that I use for cable.,"It is likely a remnant from either the initial cable-pulling process, or that connected cable is an extension that was used to ""move"" the coax to that other point in the room that you mentioned.  I would see what happens if you disconnect it - does the coax stop working somewhere else in your house?  That's the surest way to find out what it is used for."
36,"I've read 1, 2, 3 and of course, 4.  Then I read 5 and 6 and even 7.","There is no clear line. If everything else is going well, people won't notice that your coincidence is far fetched. The same plot resolution in another story might be considered ""too much"" to believe. But, let's try this:"
37,I understand that Mentats have replaced the computers but the Mentats don't seem to be that many in number. From my understanding each house only has one Mentat. Now Mentats make perfect sense for doing political and other projections for the great houses but it would be impossible for a Mentat to replace the everyday control systems.,"Mentats don't replace computers. They replace computers that ""are made in the likeness of the human mind"" - that is, Artificial Intelligences."
38,"I know its questionable whether such an entity could exist, but if there were entities big enough to be mistaken for a planet, how could it reproduce? Would two collide and recombine into three or would it be in a nebula?","If the creatures can be mistaken for planets, then by duck typing, they must have the following properties:"
39,"In this build from the World Builder game, it appears the blue and green stripes running up the length of the tower take up 1/3 of 4 studs. Is this or a close enough approximation possible to achieve, or is this just artistic liberty from the game designers? I know a plate is 1/3 of a brick height-wise (3.2 / 9.6 mm) but apparently is 2/5 width-wise (3.2 / 8 mm). So stacking plates horizontally it in theory could be approximated by 3 plates, 4 plates, 3 plates.","I think you are looking in perspective at a digital render of a tower base that has 1x2 blue bricks on each side (1 wide) with a 2x2 lime brick in the center. It only appears to be 1/3-1/3-1/3, but is in fact 1/4-1/2-1/4. You can see this best if you zoom in on the base plate and look at how the studs line up with the lowest tier of the base."
40,"Using homogeneity of space, isotropy of space and the principle of relativity (without the constancy of light speed), one can derive:","As said in the answer of @m4r35n357 it is the case of Euclidean geometry. To see this, look at the transformations, that preserve the distance : $$ds^2 = dx^2 + dt^2$$"
41,"I found few professors having supervised more than 200 masters theses 'each' in the past 14-15 years. When looked at these theses, I found that out of 200 theses supervised by a professor, more than 100 works were based on the same idea:","This is a poor supervisory practice. Unfortunately, it becomes increasingly common in Universities, particularly in countries with strong marketalization of Higher Education (e.g. US, UK). Students are treated as customers, and academics are assessed and promoted based on their ""efficiency"" in terms of the number of students they supervise, not the quality of education they provide. The pressure on academics to supervise more students is constantly increasing, and they rarely have enough time to meaningfully prepare to supervisory meetings. It is not surprising that many academics find it convenient to reuse the same projects over and over again."
42,"So I wanted to go with a friend to Scotland for 4 to 5 days. We would arrive at Edinburgh by plane. We wanted to rent a car so we could go where we wanted to to hike, but we would have to pay double the price because of the young driver fee. That would make the whole trip really expensive for five days, not even taking into account plane tickets, oil and food.","Not only is this possible, it would be my preferred way of doing it. Scotland has very good rail and bus connections, and the railways run through some of the best scenery and over some of the most spectacular bridges in the world. What's the point of renting a car and leaving it in a parking lot while you hike? Using public transport also means you can do an end-to-end hike without having to return to your start point to pick up a car."

44,"DISCLAIMER: No, this is not a duplicate of this question. We are talking about reentering Venus' atmosphere as opposed to Earth, and the suit parameters are rather different to a current suit.","No, you would burn up in the atmosphere of Venus. The Safer unit can supply an orbital delta V of perhaps 3 m/s, whilst orbital speed around Venus will be very roughly 8000 m/s so it won't make any difference. The parachute would not work at orbital speeds, it would be shredded and burnt. Even with sufficient braking the atmosphere is so dense and hot that you would die long before reaching the ground."
45,"I have been studying the bests practices for a good code review and I don't know if when I'm doing a code review and I see code improvements, but they are outside of the scope of the pull request (PR). Should I ask to do the refactor in that same pull request?",There are several relevant trade-offs here:
46,"I just studied Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in school and I came up with an interesting problem.
 Assume an electron which is moving very slowly and we observe it with a distance uncertainty of say $\Delta  x=1\times10^{-13} \text{ m}$ if we try finding uncertainty of velocity using the formula $$\Delta  x \cdot \Delta v\ge \dfrac{h}{4\pi m}$$
$$\Delta v=578838179.9 \text{ m/s}$$ Which is clearly greater than the speed of light but that is not possible. How did physicists overcome this challenge?
","The right formula is
$$\Delta X \Delta P \geq  h/4\pi$$
where $P$ is the momentum which is approximatively  $mv$ only for small velocities $v$ when compared with $c$. Otherwise you have to use the relativistic expression
$$P = mv/ \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}.$$
If $\Delta X$ is small, then $\Delta P$ is large but, according to the formula above,  the speed remains of the order of $c$ at most. That is  because, in the formula  above, $P\to +\infty$ corresponds to $v\to c$."
47,"I am trying to understand the precise (objective) history of either the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) practice of separating children (minors) of illegal immigrants from their parents when the parents are arrested for deportation. Meaning: John and Jane Doe and their (say) 5-year old son Jake are found living here in the United States illegally; ICE comes and arrests them and intends to deport them back to their country of origin, and John/Jane are separated from Jake for some duration of time.","This practice has been going on for decades - if a child's parents are criminally prosecuted and held in federal prison awaiting trial, then family separation must occur as a consequence as children may not be held in federal prison. In addition, due to the 1997 Flores Settlement, children may not be held in an immigration detention center for longer than 20 days. As a result, if a child's parents are held in a detention center for longer than this period, the child is required to be separated from their parents."
48,"I'm considering writing a story taking place in a base on Saturn's closest moon, Pan. The premise for the base is that they got Earth-normal gravity by setting the moon spinning, causing anything on the surface to fly outward due to centrifugal force (or centripetal, whatever you'd like to call it). I've calculated that it should need to make a full rotation once every four minutes (1.5 degrees per second) to have Earth-normal gravity.",Reality check: This will tear the moon apart.
49,I recently did a long ride and didn't move my hands enough. The pinky and ring finger on my right hand went numb and the webbing between thumb and index burned and ached.,"""Cyclist's Palsy"" shouldn't happen at all. Find someone competent to help you fit your bike. My first suggestion is the nose of your saddle it too low causing you to lean forward and put pressure on your hands. Whatever the cause, you need to find it and fix it before you do permanent damage."
50,"I was quite young when I saw the 1971 film Andromeda Strain in the theatre, and the image of the monkey dying when exposed to the organism still bothers me.",Torture is a strong word but it could easily be described as mistreating the creature but it does seem to have been done under the supervision of the ASPCA.
51,"Do you know any example of a river that does not flow into sea or lake? For example, if water rises from the underground spring and forms a river but water vaporises in hot climate before it reaches any larger body of water. Or if there is a valley with very moderate precipitation and many little creeks flow out of the valley and the water from them is absorbed by the soil.",The Okavango River is a good example of this. It drains into a swampy delta in the middle of the Kalahari desert:
52,"My mother died in West Virginia.  I am her son and the executor of her will, in which the home was bequeathed to me. The estate has insufficient funds to pay medical and other debts. Can WV probate court force me to sell the home to pay the medical and other debts?

56,My mother co-signed a car loan for her grandson ~3 years prior to her death . He defaulted on the loan and the car was repo'd AFTER her death. Can the loan company come after her WV estate for the debt? The car was sold prior to the estate receiving notification.,"A co-signer is equally liable for the debt, so the loan company can go after the grandson or your mother for the remainder of the debt. He would have gotten a letter from the creditor saying that the car had been sold for some amount (assuming that didn't take the car in full payment of the debt). The creditor is not limited to legal proceedings against the grandson – collecting from your mother's estate is another option. There is a 4 year statute of limitations on auto loans from the time of the breach, so waiting it out is probably not plausible."

That is, algebraic circuits of size $n^{O(1)}$ computing a polynomial of degree $n^{O(1)}$ can be rebalanced to have depth $O(\log^2 n)$ while only increasing the size by a polynomial factor. This is due to Valiant, Skyum, Berkowitz, and Rackoff.

When looked at these theses, I found that out of 200 theses supervised by a professor, more than 100 works were based on the same idea:","This is a poor supervisory practice. Unfortunately, it becomes increasingly common in Universities, particularly in countries with strong marketalization of Higher Education (e.g. US, UK). Students are treated as customers, and academics are assessed and promoted based on their ""efficiency"" in terms of the number of students they supervise, not the quality of education they provide. The pressure on academics to supervise more students is constantly increasing, and they rarely have enough time to meaningfully prepare to supervisory meetings. It is not surprising that many academics find it convenient to reuse the same projects over and over again."

Now I fear if we're handing in the manuscript plus the code to a journal for peer review it will be rejected or ridiculed. Is this possible?","You will not have a paper rejected for poor coding style. Particularly not in bioinformatics. Unless the paper is a tool development paper, the chance that a reviewer even looks at the code is not that high, and if they do, it will just be to check that its reasonable.

115,My mother co-signed a car loan for her grandson ~3 years prior to her death . He defaulted on the loan and the car was repo'd AFTER her death. Can the loan company come after her WV estate for the debt? The car was sold prior to the estate receiving notification.,"A co-signer is equally liable for the debt, so the loan company can go after the grandson or your mother for the remainder of the debt. He would have gotten a letter from the creditor saying that the car had been sold for some amount (assuming that didn't take the car in full payment of the debt). The creditor is not limited to legal proceedings against the grandson – collecting from your mother's estate is another option. There is a 4 year statute of limitations on auto loans from the time of the breach, so waiting it out is probably not plausible."

132,"What is the purpose of the self word in Python? I understand it refers to the specific object created from that class, but I can't see why it explicitly needs to be added to every function as a parameter. To illustrate, in Ruby I can do this:","The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on. That makes methods entirely the same as functions, and leaves the actual name to use up to you (although self is the convention, and people will generally frown at you when you use something else.) self is not special to the code, it's just another object."

In addition, due to the 1997 Flores Settlement, children may not be held in an immigration detention center for longer than 20 days.

 Assume an electron which is moving very slowly and we observe it with a distance uncertainty of say $\Delta  x=1\times10^{-13} \text{ m}$ if we try finding uncertainty of velocity using the formula $$\Delta  x \cdot \Delta v\ge \dfrac{h}{4\pi m}$$
$$\Delta v=578838179.9 \text{ m/s}$$ Which is clearly greater than the speed of light but that is not possible. How did physicists overcome this challenge?
","The right formula is
$$\Delta X \Delta P \geq  h/4\pi$$
where $P$ is the momentum which is approximatively  $mv$ only for small velocities $v$ when compared with $c$. Otherwise you have to use the relativistic expression
$$P = mv/ \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}.$$
If $\Delta X$ is small, then $\Delta P$ is large but, according to the formula above,  the speed remains of the order of $c$ at most. That is  because, in the formula  above, $P\to +\infty$ corresponds to $v\to c$."

The closest thing I have been able to find while searching here is the annotate command, but that appears to create a fixed label on the plot. Unfortunately, with the number of points that I have, the scatter plot would be unreadable if I labeled each point. Does anyone know of a way to create labels that only appear when the cursor hovers in the vicinity of that point?",It seems none of the other answers here actually answer the question. So here is a code that uses a scatter and shows an annotation upon hovering over the scatter points.

This is very inflexible, should you need to request the data for more or fewer games. Just use one class to represent a game.

595,I'm a Java developer who's toyed around with Python on and off. I recently stumbled upon this article which mentions common mistakes Java programmers make when they pick up Python. The first one caught my eye:,"The most straightforward way to think about it is to think in terms of what type of object the method needs in order to do its work.  If your method needs access to an instance, make it a regular method.  If it needs access to the class, make it a classmethod.  If it doesn't need access to the class or the instance, make it a function.  There is rarely a need to make something a staticmethod, but if you find you want a function to be ""grouped"" with a class (e.g., so it can be overridden) even though it doesn't need access to the class, I guess you could make it a staticmethod."

This is very inflexible, should you need to request the data for more or fewer games. Just use one class to represent a game. It looks like all the attributes in your game classes are identical except for the key or index used to access GAMEID. Therefore, just use a range based loop to get as many instances of the same class as you need, storing the instances in a data structure such as a list. This is exactly the motivation for having a class in the first place; you bundle data and functionality together so you can reuse it."

 Assume an electron which is moving very slowly and we observe it with a distance uncertainty of say $\Delta  x=1\times10^{-13} \text{ m}$ if we try finding uncertainty of velocity using the formula $$\Delta  x \cdot \Delta v\ge \dfrac{h}{4\pi m}$$
$$\Delta v=578838179.9 \text{ m/s}$$ Which is clearly greater than the speed of light but that is not possible. How did physicists overcome this challenge?
","The right formula is
$$\Delta X \Delta P \geq  h/4\pi$$
where $P$ is the momentum which is approximatively  $mv$ only for small velocities $v$ when compared with $c$. Otherwise you have to use the relativistic expression
$$P = mv/ \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}.$$
If $\Delta X$ is small, then $\Delta P$ is large but, according to the formula above,  the speed remains of the order of $c$ at most. That is  because, in the formula  above, $P\to +\infty$ corresponds to $v\to c$."

Scotland has very good rail and bus connections, and the railways run through some of the best scenery and over some of the most spectacular bridges in the world.

He would have gotten a letter from the creditor saying that the car had been sold for some amount (assuming that didn't take the car in full payment of the debt).

In addition, due to the 1997 Flores Settlement, children may not be held in an immigration detention center for longer than 20 days.

 Assume an electron which is moving very slowly and we observe it with a distance uncertainty of say $\Delta  x=1\times10^{-13} \text{ m}$ if we try finding uncertainty of velocity using the formula $$\Delta  x \cdot \Delta v\ge \dfrac{h}{4\pi m}$$

","The right formula is
$$\Delta X \Delta P \geq  h/4\pi$$
where $P$ is the momentum which is approximatively  $mv$ only for small velocities $v$ when compared with $c$. Otherwise you have to use the relativistic expression
$$P = mv/ \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}.$$
If $\Delta X$ is small, then $\Delta P$ is large but, according to the formula above,  the speed remains of the order of $c$ at most. That is  because, in the formula  above, $P\to +\infty$ corresponds to $v\to c$."

At best (which would be more readable anyway, since the condition for the break is up there with the while), you could create a variable result = None and loop while it is None.

 Assume an electron which is moving very slowly and we observe it with a distance uncertainty of say $\Delta  x=1\times10^{-13} \text{ m}$ if we try finding uncertainty of velocity using the formula $$\Delta  x \cdot \Delta v\ge \dfrac{h}{4\pi m}$$
$$\Delta v=578838179.9 \text{ m/s}$$ Which is clearly greater than the speed of light but that is not possible. How did physicists overcome this challenge?
","The right formula is
$$\Delta X \Delta P \geq  h/4\pi$$
where $P$ is the momentum which is approximatively  $mv$ only for small velocities $v$ when compared with $c$. Otherwise you have to use the relativistic expression
$$P = mv/ \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}.$$
If $\Delta X$ is small, then $\Delta P$ is large but, according to the formula above,  the speed remains of the order of $c$ at most. That is  because, in the formula  above, $P\to +\infty$ corresponds to $v\to c$."

This is very inflexible, should you need to request the data for more or fewer games. Just use one class to represent a game. It looks like all the attributes in your game classes are identical except for the key or index used to access GAMEID. Therefore, just use a range based loop to get as many instances of the same class as you need, storing the instances in a data structure such as a list. This is exactly the motivation for having a class in the first place; you bundle data and functionality together so you can reuse it."

When looked at these theses, I found that out of 200 theses supervised by a professor, more than 100 works were based on the same idea:","This is a poor supervisory practice. Unfortunately, it becomes increasingly common in Universities, particularly in countries with strong marketalization of Higher Education (e.g. US, UK). Students are treated as customers, and academics are assessed and promoted based on their ""efficiency"" in terms of the number of students they supervise, not the quality of education they provide. The pressure on academics to supervise more students is constantly increasing, and they rarely have enough time to meaningfully prepare to supervisory meetings.

The fairing is usally separated at a height of about 100 km before the rocket is orbital. Therefore the fairing has a suborbital flight and reenters the athmosphere. Separating the fairing early leaves more fuel to be used for the payload. If the fairing would be separated just before the payload at orbit insertion, the maximal payload weight is reduced."

As I understand from the documentation send() function uses TCP protocol and sendall() function uses UDP protocol for sending data.

That's why, I think use of send() function can be more reliable rather than sendall() function. ","socket.send is a low-level method and basically just the C/syscall method send(3) / send(2).

The solution is, of course, $f(x) = \int g(x) dx$, so for this specific equation the question you're asking reduces to the question of ""which simple functions have simple antiderivatives"".  Some famous examples (such as $g(x) = e^{-x^2}$) show that even simple-looking expressions can have antiderivatives that can't be expressed in such a simple-looking way."

2151,"I am trying to solve the 1-D heat equation numerically with a variable source term. The system is basically a tank containing styrene in which it polymerizes to liberate heat. I have assumed that the cross-section of the tank is much smaller compared to the length so any variations in the y and z directions can be neglected. I am starting with $T_0 = 313.15 \text{K}$. The domain space I am looking at is $0 \leq x\leq 5\text{m}$ and $t \geq 0$. The equations are as follows. I write the heat equation as-
$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{\rho C_p}\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{\rho C_p}\left(\frac{\rho\Delta H}{MW}\frac{\partial m}{\partial t}\right)$$
The $\frac{\partial m}{\partial t}$ is basically the rate of reaction expressed in terms of the mole fraction $m$. The rate of reaction is-
$$\frac{\partial m}{\partial t} = -A\left(\frac{\rho}{MW}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}m^{\frac{5}{2}}$$
Here:
$$k = 0.03 \hspace{8pt} \text{[cal/(s-m-K)]}$$
$$A = A_0\exp(A_1m_p + A_2m_p^2 + A_3m_p^3)$$
where:
$$m_p = 1-m$$
$$A_0 = 1.964\times10^5\exp\left(\frac{-10,040}{T}\right)$$ $$A_1 = 2.57-5.05\times10^{-3}T$$ $$A_2 = 9.56-1.76\times10^{-2}T$$ $$A_3 = -3.03+7.85\times10^{-3}T$$
The rest of the values are constants and they are-
$$\rho = 906 \hspace{6pt} \text {[g/L]}$$ $$MW = 104.15 \hspace{6pt} \text{[g/mol]}$$ $$C_p = 0.4365 \hspace{6pt} \text{[cal/g-K]}$$ $$\Delta H = -17,300 \hspace{6pt}\text{[cal/mole]}$$
The initial conditions are-
$$T = T_0$$ $$m = 1$$
The boundary conditions are-
$@ x= 0$ $$ \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = 0, \hspace{5pt} \frac{\partial m}{\partial x} = 0$$
$@ x= 5m$ $$ \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = 0, \hspace{5pt} \frac{\partial m}{\partial x} = 0$$
I am assuming that there is no flux at either boundary. I used the 'pdepe' command in MATLAB to solve this system of coupled PDEs. Here's the code I wrote-","You are starting from a uniform temperature and you have insulated
boundary conditions; so there is no heat conduction occurring.
Likewise, your initial mole fraction is also constant in $x$ so that
the heat input is uniform along the length. So the fact that the
temperature and mole fraction don't change as a function of $x$ is
exactly what you should expect."

Or do they want to say that from 1992, every year, for 28 years Earth picked up debris left behind so many years ago while passing the August part of orbit? It's logical to assume that all this debris would be exhausted by now...","The comet sheds material each time it get close to the sun. The sun heats this dirty snow ball, the ice evaporates and tears dust and smaller rocks with it.
These dust particles then follow a similar orbit around the sun as the comet. But as they are ejected with some velocity and react differently to the solar wind & radiation, their orbit is slightly different from their parent comet.
Different orbit means generally different orbital velocity and, over time, the particles spread out along the comets orbital path. They form a steam of material that constantly dissipates and is replenished each time the comets approaches perihelion.
And each time the earth passes through the part of the solar system this stream occupies, we see meteor."

Having spent a while programming in c before coming to Python, I was astonished at how easily Python does away with all the complexities of pointer dereferencing that drive me mad in c. In Python everything just works the way I expect, and I quickly realized that the mutable/immutable distinction plays an important part in that.","Objective C is loaded with mutable/immutable distinctions (to the point where there are both NSString and NSMutableString, for example); it predates Python by about 8 years.

I was going to use the two turning points to get my three unknowns (xoffset, yoffset and angle of rotation), but the 2nd turning point is a bit too far toward the right because RDP simplified away the smoother curve in this region.  So instead I used the angle of the line segment leading up to the 1st turning point.  Differencing this angle between image1 and image2 gives me the rotation angle.

The power you would get from learning a little RDF and SPARQL may very well be worth your while.  If you know SQL already then you are off to a great start.  Being able to query your graph using SPARQL would yield some great benefits to you.  Serializing to RDF triples would be easy, and some of the file formats are super easy ( NT for instance ).  I'll give an example.  Lets say you have the following graph node-edge-node ids:"

There is no magic in Python's file class that would cause instances to share state; file is a wrapper for an ordinary C file handle, which itself encapsulates an OS file descriptor, and the implementation of file.tell() and file.seek() call the corresponding C stdio functions. (For the messy details see CPython's fileobject.c.) There can be differences between the C library behavior and the underlying OS's behavior, but in this particular case that's not a factor."

It's logical to assume that all this debris would be exhausted by now...","The comet sheds material each time it get close to the sun. The sun heats this dirty snow ball, the ice evaporates and tears dust and smaller rocks with it.
These dust particles then follow a similar orbit around the sun as the comet. But as they are ejected with some velocity and react differently to the solar wind & radiation, their orbit is slightly different from their parent comet.
Different orbit means generally different orbital velocity and, over time, the particles spread out along the comets orbital path. They form a steam of material that constantly dissipates and is replenished each time the comets approaches perihelion.
And each time the earth passes through the part of the solar system this stream occupies, we see meteor."

Sometimes this inevitably fails, be it due to DM being unclear, or the players being distracted. But the DM as the ultimate authority over all aspectes of the game world, except player actions.

The domain space I am looking at is $0 \leq x\leq 5\text{m}$ and $t \geq 0$. The equations are as follows. I write the heat equation as-
$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{\rho C_p}\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{\rho C_p}\left(\frac{\rho\Delta H}{MW}\frac{\partial m}{\partial t}\right)$$
The $\frac{\partial m}{\partial t}$ is basically the rate of reaction expressed in terms of the mole fraction $m$. The rate of reaction is-
$$\frac{\partial m}{\partial t} = -A\left(\frac{\rho}{MW}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}m^{\frac{5}{2}}$$
Here:
$$k = 0.03 \hspace{8pt} \text{[cal/(s-m-K)]}$$
$$A = A_0\exp(A_1m_p + A_2m_p^2 + A_3m_p^3)$$
where:
$$m_p = 1-m$$
$$A_0 = 1.964\times10^5\exp\left(\frac{-10,040}{T}\right)$$ $$A_1 = 2.57-5.05\times10^{-3}T$$ $$A_2 = 9.56-1.76\times10^{-2}T$$ $$A_3 = -3.03+7.85\times10^{-3}T$$
The rest of the values are constants and they are-
$$\rho = 906 \hspace{6pt} \text {[g/L]}$$ $$MW = 104.15 \hspace{6pt} \text{[g/mol]}$$ $$C_p = 0.4365 \hspace{6pt} \text{[cal/g-K]}$$ $$\Delta H = -17,300 \hspace{6pt}\text{[cal/mole]}$$
The initial conditions are-
$$T = T_0$$ $$m = 1$$
The boundary conditions are-
$@ x= 0$ $$ \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = 0, \hspace{5pt} \frac{\partial m}{\partial x} = 0$$
$@ x= 5m$ $$ \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = 0, \hspace{5pt} \frac{\partial m}{\partial x} = 0$$
I am assuming that there is no flux at either boundary. I used the 'pdepe' command in MATLAB to solve this system of coupled PDEs. Here's the code I wrote-","You are starting from a uniform temperature and you have insulated
boundary conditions; so there is no heat conduction occurring.
Likewise, your initial mole fraction is also constant in $x$ so that
the heat input is uniform along the length. So the fact that the
temperature and mole fraction don't change as a function of $x$ is
exactly what you should expect."

For a carrier this would be about 60-70ft. The helicopter would normally be using a radalt height hold at this point and would close the ship at a slow speed. The ship would be dropping marker flares into the water from the stern, as the aircraft gets closer the closing speed would be reduced to 10-15kts above the ship speed until visual. Unlike a radar controlled approach, there is no planned go-around for this procedure however, if a land based diversion was available, this would be used first."

Further, simple differential equations made of basic functions usually tend to have ludicrously complicated solutions or be unsolvable. Is there some deeper reasoning behind why it is so rare to find solutions? Or is it just that every time we can solve differential equations, it is just an algebraic coincidence?","Let's consider the following, very simple, differential equation: $f'(x) = g(x)$, where $g(x)$ is some given function.  The solution is, of course, $f(x) = \int g(x) dx$, so for this specific equation the question you're asking reduces to the question of ""which simple functions have simple antiderivatives"".  Some famous examples (such as $g(x) = e^{-x^2}$) show that even simple-looking expressions can have antiderivatives that can't be expressed in such a simple-looking way."
