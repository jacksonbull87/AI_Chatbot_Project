I know a plate is 1/3 of a brick height-wise (3.2 / 9.6 mm) but apparently is 2/5 width-wise (3.2 / 8 mm).

56,"I found few professors having supervised more than 200 masters theses 'each' in the past 14-15 years. When looked at these theses, I found that out of 200 theses supervised by a professor, more than 100 works were based on the same idea:","This is a poor supervisory practice. Unfortunately, it becomes increasingly common in Universities, particularly in countries with strong marketalization of Higher Education (e.g. US, UK). Students are treated as customers, and academics are assessed and promoted based on their efficiency (meaning the number of students they supervise), not the quality of education they provide. The pressure on academics to supervise more students is constantly increasing, and they rarely have enough time to meaningfully prepare to supervisory meetings. It is not surprising that many academics find it convenient to reuse the same projects over and over again."
57,"So I wanted to go with a friend to Scotland for 4 to 5 days. We would arrive at Edinburgh by plane.

Scotland has very good rail and bus connections, and the railways run through some of the best scenery and over some of the most spectacular bridges in the world. What's the point of renting a car and leaving it in a parking lot while you hike? Using public transport also means you can do an end-to-end hike without having to return to your start point to pick up a car."

62,"I am trying to understand the precise (objective) history of either the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) practice of separating children (minors) of illegal immigrants from their parents when the parents are arrested for deportation.

He would have gotten a letter from the creditor saying that the car had been sold for some amount (assuming that didn't take the car in full payment of the debt). The creditor is not limited to legal proceedings against the grandson – collecting from your mother's estate is another option.

982,Yes! The trick is to count each input with its <em>effective value</em> rather than its nominal value.,"Kind of, but coin selection is hard in general. The idea is that inputs pay for themselves. It is easy to compute how much in fees you will need to pay for an input at a given fee rate. So when you do coin selection, instead of selecting on the actual value of the input, you use the value of the input minus the fees it will pay. This is known as the effective value."

Wilczek. 1987. Self-propulsion at low Reynolds number. Phys. Rev. Lett. 58: 2051–2054 where they use gauge theory to describe micro-swimming.  Because the Stokes equation - the infinite viscosity limit of Navier-Stokes - is linear, it allows us  to define a connection for the principal G bundle:
(located shapes) --&gt; (unlocated shapes). Here G is the group of rigid motions of space,  a located shape is (say) a volume-preserving embedding of the ball into usual 3-space, and  the space of unlocated shapes is the quotient space of the space of located shapes by the action of G.  Think of the ball as the cell (parmecium, E Coli, cyanobacterium, ..) which wants to move.   A swimming stroke is then  a loop in the space of unlocated shapes.  The resulting holonomy for the Stokes connection is computed by solving the Stokes equation with zero boundary data at infinity.  Shapere in his thesis estimates the curvature at the embedding which is a round ball, and thereby investigates ``infinitesimal swimming motions''.  Some of this story can also be found in my book, A Tour of SubRiemannian Geometry."

Because the Stokes equation - the infinite viscosity limit of Navier-Stokes - is linear, it allows us  to define a connection for the principal G bundle:
(located shapes) --&gt; (unlocated shapes). Here G is the group of rigid motions of space,  a located shape is (say) a volume-preserving embedding of the ball into usual 3-space, and  the space of unlocated shapes is the quotient space of the space of located shapes by the action of G.  Think of the ball as the cell (parmecium, E Coli, cyanobacterium, ..) which wants to move.   A swimming stroke is then  a loop in the space of unlocated shapes.  The resulting holonomy for the Stokes connection is computed by solving the Stokes equation with zero boundary data at infinity.  Shapere in his thesis estimates the curvature at the embedding which is a round ball, and thereby investigates ``infinitesimal swimming motions''.

Here G is the group of rigid motions of space,  a located shape is (say) a volume-preserving embedding of the ball into usual 3-space, and  the space of unlocated shapes is the quotient space of the space of located shapes by the action of G.  Think of the ball as the cell (parmecium, E Coli, cyanobacterium, ..) which wants to move.   A swimming stroke is then  a loop in the space of unlocated shapes.  The resulting holonomy for the Stokes connection is computed by solving the Stokes equation with zero boundary data at infinity.  Shapere in his thesis estimates the curvature at the embedding which is a round ball, and thereby investigates ``infinitesimal swimming motions''.

Wilczek. 1987. Self-propulsion at low Reynolds number. Phys. Rev. Lett. 58: 2051–2054 where they use gauge theory to describe micro-swimming.  Because the Stokes equation - the infinite viscosity limit of Navier-Stokes - is linear, it allows us  to define a connection for the principal G bundle:
(located shapes) --&gt; (unlocated shapes). Here G is the group of rigid motions of space,  a located shape is (say) a volume-preserving embedding of the ball into usual 3-space, and  the space of unlocated shapes is the quotient space of the space of located shapes by the action of G.  Think of the ball as the cell (parmecium, E Coli, cyanobacterium, ..) which wants to move.   A swimming stroke is then  a loop in the space of unlocated shapes.  The resulting holonomy for the Stokes connection is computed by solving the Stokes equation with zero boundary data at infinity.  Shapere in his thesis estimates the curvature at the embedding which is a round ball, and thereby investigates ``infinitesimal swimming motions''.

This distinction has been mostly ignored for a long time because of the historic ubiquity of encodings with no more than 256 characters (ASCII, Latin-1, Windows-1252, Mac OS Roman,…): these encodings map a set of common characters to numbers between 0 and 255 (i.e. bytes); the relatively limited exchange of files before the advent of the web made this situation of incompatible encodings tolerable, as most programs could ignore the fact that there were multiple encodings as long as they produced text that remained on the same operating system: such programs would simply treat text as bytes (through the encoding used by the operating system). The correct, modern view properly separates these two string concepts, based on the following two points:","Python always encodes Unicode strings when writing to a terminal, file, pipe, etc.  When writing to a terminal Python can usually determine the encoding of the terminal and use it correctly.  When writing to a file or pipe Python defaults to the 'ascii' encoding unless explicitly told otherwise.  Python can be told what to do when piping output through the PYTHONIOENCODING environment variable.  A shell can set this variable before redirecting Python output to a file or pipe so the correct encoding is known."

Because the Stokes equation - the infinite viscosity limit of Navier-Stokes - is linear, it allows us  to define a connection for the principal G bundle:
(located shapes) --&gt; (unlocated shapes). Here G is the group of rigid motions of space,  a located shape is (say) a volume-preserving embedding of the ball into usual 3-space, and  the space of unlocated shapes is the quotient space of the space of located shapes by the action of G.  Think of the ball as the cell (parmecium, E Coli, cyanobacterium, ..) which wants to move.   A swimming stroke is then  a loop in the space of unlocated shapes.  The resulting holonomy for the Stokes connection is computed by solving the Stokes equation with zero boundary data at infinity.  Shapere in his thesis estimates the curvature at the embedding which is a round ball, and thereby investigates ``infinitesimal swimming motions''.

The mRNA in an mRNA vaccine alone cannot edit DNA, in the CRISPR gene editing method the actual act of cutting the DNA to edit it is performed by Cas9, which is an enzyme, not RNA.","This is an open-ended question which invites speculative scenarios - most and hopefully all of which will have been carefully considered during vaccine development.  In concept the vaccine could alter DNA in several very rare and unusual ways, such as if the recipient has HIV and the vaccine RNA became a substrate for the viral reverse transcriptase.  More plausibly, the recipient might produce an RNA transcript (possibly produced by a transposable element of viral origin) which base-pairs with the vaccine RNA.  This would set off cellular antiviral alarms that could lead to the possibly permanent modification of DNA with methyl groups ( see ""https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02889"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02889 ).

Wilczek. 1987. Self-propulsion at low Reynolds number. Phys. Rev. Lett. 58: 2051–2054 where they use gauge theory to describe micro-swimming.  Because the Stokes equation - the infinite viscosity limit of Navier-Stokes - is linear, it allows us  to define a connection for the principal G bundle:
(located shapes) --&gt; (unlocated shapes). Here G is the group of rigid motions of space,  a located shape is (say) a volume-preserving embedding of the ball into usual 3-space, and  the space of unlocated shapes is the quotient space of the space of located shapes by the action of G.  Think of the ball as the cell (parmecium, E Coli, cyanobacterium, ..) which wants to move.   A swimming stroke is then  a loop in the space of unlocated shapes.  The resulting holonomy for the Stokes connection is computed by solving the Stokes equation with zero boundary data at infinity.  Shapere in his thesis estimates the curvature at the embedding which is a round ball, and thereby investigates ``infinitesimal swimming motions''.  Some of this story can also be found in my book, A Tour of SubRiemannian Geometry."

In concept the vaccine could alter DNA in several very rare and unusual ways, such as if the recipient has HIV and the vaccine RNA became a substrate for the viral reverse transcriptase.  More plausibly, the recipient might produce an RNA transcript (possibly produced by a transposable element of viral origin) which base-pairs with the vaccine RNA.

This is actually not true in normal quantum mechanics, but it is true in Quantum Field Theory. All paths contribute to the Feynman path integral. However, the question of whether the particle is actually travelling faster than light along some of these paths is not well defined. We can measure the particle at one point, and then at another point. The paths that you get by connecting these observation points will never be faster than light. What happens between the observation points is not something you can see or measure."
1731,There are a few economical reasons to rent instead of buy including if the cost are similar.,"Buying means you are taking on the risk associated with the price fluctuation of the property.

1736,To look at a different situation - if you are writing software that will not be changed in the future then you could skip the tests.  I have yet to work with such software of course :),"Yes. Because those bits that do not change still need testing. The rest that does change, well, that's just a part of the process, you simply need to change things once in a while.

I also need to be able to have a colorbar legend to help interpret it.,"It's pretty straight forward to create a barchart and set the bar colors according to a value from the dataframe. A colormap and a normalization instance help converting the values to colors, which are understood by the color argument of matplotlib.Axes.bar. The colorbar is then created from  a ScalarMappable using the same normalization and colormap as the bars."

The main problem would be the CoG(Center of Gravity/Mass/Balance), which would probably be in the center of the 'head'. However, when taking a step, the narrow rectangle between the 2 legs where the CoG can be to avoid falling over becomes a small square over the foot. Here's an excerpt from the first time this walker was introduced to the story-","Or, it just does what humans and other bipeds do: it makes use of a combination of dynamic stability, making sure that weight is transferred from one foot to the other before it has time to fall, and flexibility in the hip joint to permit keeping the feet close to or directly under the center of gravity when planted and only moving outwards to swing around each other when moving."

Is that also to slow bacteria growth, is it more about preservation of quality by preventing oxidation, or is it something else?","In addition to keeping odors contained and limiting the possibility of cross-contamination, oxygen degrades the quality of food.

Some famous examples (such as <span class=""math-container"">$g(x) = e^{-x^2}$</span>) show that even simple-looking expressions can have antiderivatives that can't be expressed in such a simple-looking way., Compare Differential Equations to Polynomial Equations. Polynomial Equations are, arguably, much, <strong>much</strong> more simple. The solution space is smaller, and the fundamental operations that build the equations (multiplication, addition and subtraction) are extremely simple and well understood. Yet (and we can even prove this!) <strong>there are Polynomial Equations for which we cannot find an analytical solution</strong>. In this way - I don't think it's any surprise that we cannot find nice analytical solutions to almost all Differential Equations. It would be a shock if we could!","I made this flowchart for my students last time I taught this stuff.

When methods were added to the str type (in Python 1.5?) the functions were left in the string module for compatibility, but now just forward to the equivalent str method.","zipfile.ZipFile accepts any file-like object, so you can use StringIO (2.x) or BytesIO (3.x):, Wrap your string in a ""http://docs.python.org/library/stringio.html#module-cStringIO"" rel=""noreferrer"">cStringIO object.

Rather, most proofs are written out of a kind of obligation, as a sort of run-away argument; not presenting proofs at all is considered unacceptable, but writing them in exhausting details would burn the author out as well as endanger the reader getting lost in the woods.

Some famous examples (such as <span class=""math-container"">$g(x) = e^{-x^2}$</span>) show that even simple-looking expressions can have antiderivatives that can't be expressed in such a simple-looking way., Compare Differential Equations to Polynomial Equations. Polynomial Equations are, arguably, much, <strong>much</strong> more simple. The solution space is smaller, and the fundamental operations that build the equations (multiplication, addition and subtraction) are extremely simple and well understood. Yet (and we can even prove this!) <strong>there are Polynomial Equations for which we cannot find an analytical solution</strong>. In this way - I don't think it's any surprise that we cannot find nice analytical solutions to almost all Differential Equations.
