statistics analysis definition,"Statistical analysis is the science of collecting data and uncovering patterns and trends. It‚Äôs really just another way of saying ‚Äústatistics.‚Äù After collecting data you can analyze it to:
Summarize the data. For example, make a pie chart.
Find key measures of location. For example, the mean tells you what the average (or ‚Äúmiddling‚Äù) number is in a set of data.
Calculate measures of spread: these tell you if your data is tightly clustered or more spread out. The standard deviation is one of the more commonly used measures of spread; it tells you how spread out your data is about the mean.
Make future predictions based on past behavior. This is especially useful in retail, manufacturing, banking, sports or for any organization where knowing future trends would be a benefit.
Test an experiment‚Äôs hypothesis. Collecting data from an experiment only tells a story when you analyze the data. This part of statistical analysis is more formally called ‚ÄúHypothesis Testing,‚Äù where the null hypothesis (the commonly accepted theory) is either proved or disproved.

what is normal distribution,"In probability theory, a normal (or Gaussian or Gauss or Laplace‚ÄìGauss) distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable.  Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution

Definition of statistical distributions,A statistical distribution is a representation of the frequencies of potential events or the percentage of time each event occurs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examples of Discrete Distributions ,"The Bernoulli Distribution
The Bernoulli distribution represents the probability of success for a certain experiment (the outcome being ""success or not"", so there are two possible outcomes). A coin toss is a classic example of a Bernoulli experiment with a probability of success 0.5 or 50%, but a Bernoulli experiment can have any probability of success between 0 and 1.

The Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution represents the probability of  ùëõ  events in a given time period when the overall rate of occurrence is constant. A typical example is pieces of mail. If your overall mail received is constant, the number of items received on a single day (or month) follows a Poisson distribution. Other examples might include visitors to a website, or customers arriving at a store, or clients waiting to be served in a queue.

The Uniform Distribution
The uniform distribution occurs when all possible outcomes are equally likely. The dice example shown before follows a uniform distribution with equal probabilities for throwing values from 1 to 6. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Examples of Continuous Distributions,"A normal distribution is the single most important distribution, you'll basically come across it very often. The normal distribution follows a bell shape and is a foundational distribution for many models and theories in statistics and data science. A normal distribution turns up very often when dealing with real-world data including heights, weights of different people, errors in some measurement or grades on a test",,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is a Probability Mass Function (PMF)?,"A probability mass function (PMF), sometimes referred to as a frequency function, is a function that associates probabilities with discrete random variables. You already learned about this in the context of coin flips and dice rolls. The discrete part in discrete distributions means that there is a known number of possible outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
